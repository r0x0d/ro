# ro (Read-only)

Read-only repository to share the resources that helped me build my knowledge
across the years.

>> Keep in mind that some (a lot, actually) of those resources will be random
>> and across different topics. The idea of this repository is to gather and
>> build those resources in a single place, do not expect to find only technical
>> materials here.
