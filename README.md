# ro (Read-only)

Read-only repository to share the resources that helped me build my knowledge
across the years.

> Keep in mind that some (a lot, actually) of those resources will be random
> and across different topics. The idea of this repository is to gather and
> build those resources in a single place, do not expect to find only technical
> materials here.
